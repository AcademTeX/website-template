## AcademTeX - Templates for Academics 

AcademTeX is a collection of open source academic-focused templates targeted at people working in mathematics, informatics
physics, and other fields. The purpose is to provide some well-thoughout sensible defaults for people ot use and to help
save precious time by providing out of the box automation for features like automatic LaTeX compilation with GitHub actions
and instant website updates via GitHub pages. 

### Current projects:

* [dotfiles-template](https://github.com/AcademTeX/dotfiles-template) - A collection of sensible default settings and software installations for a personal computing (Currently primarily supporting MacOS - Windows and Linux support to come). Includes settings for working with Vim, Tmux, LaTeX in the terminal and other useful software.
* [dotgithub-template](https://github.com/AcademTeX/dotgithub-template) - A template for setting up a `.github` repo. These repos are useful and allow you to automate a number of different things that are going on with your GitHub-stored code. For example, it sets up a workflow that translates all comments with `TODO: ....` in them into GitHub issues so that you can track your TODOs easier.
* [readme-template](https://github.com/AcademTeX/readme-template) - A template for setting up a personal GitHub page readme (sort of like a mini-website)
* [website-template](https://github.com/AcademTeX/website-template) - A template for setting up a personal GitHub pages website that integrates well with the other repositories. E.g. if you make a GitHub repo corresponding to a course you are either teaching or taking, then the websites will have the same theme and be published in a consistent way (e.g. `https://<github-username>.github.io` and `https://<github-username>.github.io/course-repo-name`) 
* [course-repo-template](https://github.com/AcademTeX/course-repo-template) - A template for a all the LaTeX files related to a course including homeworks and solutions, course notes, and individual lecture notes. Complete with automation and a website. 
* [article-repo-template](https://github.com/AcademTeX/article-repo-template) - An article template that comes with some nice additional scripts to make compiling and collaborating easier.
* [presentation-repo-template](https://github.com/AcademTeX/article-repo-template) - A presentation template (that is essentially a clone of the article template but for Beamer!)
